React Tooltip

Ideal time of completion: 3 - 4 hrs


Problem statement
Create a simple tooltip component such that when I hover over a button it shows me a tooltip.

Instructions
Create a simple tooltip component according to the gif below (on the next page)
On hovering of the button I should show a tooltip.
The component will receive the ‘position‘ of tooltip as prop. In the GIF (see below). We can pass options : “top”, “bottom”, “right”, “left”.
According to the position the tooltip should render at that position.
You are ALLOWED to style the switch the way you like. Do whatever you want with the styling. ONLY the functionality of the component should work.
You are ALLOWED to google and read how to approach the problem
DO NOT copy and paste code from the internet
DO NOT cheat with other students, I am trusting you all for this one!
Once you have finished with the test, make a video recording your computer screen (via phone or a software like OBS/screencastify etc) and explaining how you have approached the problem in code and showing the final product. The video can be UPTO 3 mins long. Please don’t record videos longer than that.
Upload the code to github.
Once you have recorded the video ,upload it on youtube (unlisted or whatever), drive or wherever you want to upload it. Submissions without video will not be evaluated.
